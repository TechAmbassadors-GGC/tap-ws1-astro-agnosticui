shortTitle: Leap For Mankind
title: Introducing Programming Concepts through an Interactive Scratch Workshop
id: leap-for-mankind
desc : LeapforMankind is a racing game created using Scratch. The project aims to teach the concepts of "If statements" and "while loops" through block-coding in Scratch. This project was created through TAP (Technology Ambassador Program) at GGC (Georgia Gwinnett College) which aims to introduce the IT major to audiences that wouldn't have considered the IT field piror to their experience with a TAP workshop.

{/* Right text block, Project description */}	
The primary goal of this project is teacing participants the basic logical operators and statements, such as 'if' statements and 'while' loops through block-coding in scratch.

The audience is introduced to procedural programming through an interactive activity where participants develop their own simple racing game using the Scratch programming language. Participants learn basic logical operators and statements, such as 'if' statements and 'while' loops.
The use of block code helps simplify coding concepts and makes them more accessible, creating more interest in STEM fields for students. Through the interactive drag-and-drop architecture of Scratch, students learn how certain algorithms are adopted to create the logic behind a game.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Outreach Activities:
1. Tap Expo - April 28, 2020 - Demonstration the working game to Georgia Gwinnett students and faculty via Zoom. To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students.
2. Online Virtual Workshop - April 21, 2020 - Middle school students to promote IT and STEM careers.
3. Online Virtual Classroom Workshops - April 7 and April 14, 2020 - Intro to computing and Digital media students to promote IT and STEM careers to non-IT college students.
