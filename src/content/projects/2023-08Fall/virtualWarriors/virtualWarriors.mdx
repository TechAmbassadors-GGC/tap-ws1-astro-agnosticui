{/* Right text block, Project description */}	

The aim of this project is to garner an increased interest in the video game development field and STEM by attenuating the stigma of difficulty surrounding both programming and video game development as a whole.

Roblox Studio is a game development engine that allows users to create simple and complex games in the Lua programming language. By engaging in our workshops, students will be able to experiment with Roblox Studio to learn about 3D object manipulation, basic programming, and level design.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
