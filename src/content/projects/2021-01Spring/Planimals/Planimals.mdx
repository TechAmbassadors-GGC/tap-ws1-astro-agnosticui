{/* Right text block, Project description */}

The objective of this workshop is to make coding entertaining for participants by simplifying concepts that can be applied to several different programming languages.

This workshop has participants code an unused sprite within a pre-existing game as they learn how to program a resource management system and simple character movement using variables, if-else statements, and while-loops.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Outreach Activities:
1. TAP Expo, April 1, 2021, Georgia Gwinnett College: to promote the IT field and encourage college students to sign up for TAP.
2. Class Workshops, April 13-15, 2021, Georgia Gwinnett College: to promote the IT field to non-IT students.

## Game Description
<div class="prj-txt">
The game has a grow and regress feature; if a plant/animal touches an undesired object, they will regress, and if it were to encounter their desired item, it would grow. Ideally, the animals/plants are developing through different stages of life. For instance, a bird would start in an egg, hatch into a baby bird, then develop into an adult bird.

One of the main elements that make this game challenging is that the path to winning is not a straight line. Everyone will have an individual experience depending on their skill set and how fast they catch onto the game. While it might take one person a couple of minutes to win, it may take somebody else longer. This adds a resonance of frustration and eagerness to develop your skills, change your approach and ultimately win the game.
