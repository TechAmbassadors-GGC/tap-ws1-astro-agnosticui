title: Teaching Programming Fundamentals with Candy Catch
id: candy-catch
desc : Candy Catch is a 2-player competitive item catching game that uses Scratch. Players will learn about 'if-then' and 'while' statements. The workshop strives to captivate students' interests toward the IT field by teaching them these basic programming concepts through a fun and interractive game developement proccess.

{/* Right text block, Project description */}	
The primary goal of this project is teaching participants the basic logical operators and statements, such as 'if' statements and 'while' loops through block-coding in scratch.

Scratch is a basic programming where code blocks are created visually by draagging sections of code onto a workspace.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

  ## Outreach Activities:
1. Tap Expo, April 1, 2021, GGC - To promote IT field and the TAP program to college student.
2. Class Workshops, April 12th - 14th, 2021 - To promote IT field to non-IT college students.
