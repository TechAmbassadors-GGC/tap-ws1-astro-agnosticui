{/* Right text block, Project description */}	

Fruit Rain aims to teach programming fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. Through interactive gameplay, participants learn about variables, strings, conditionals, and arithmetic operators. The project encourages students to explore programming concepts and consider careers in technology.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
