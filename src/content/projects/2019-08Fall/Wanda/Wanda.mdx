{/* Right text block, Project description */}	
Interactive technology can be used to teach programming concepts to students more easily. Technology can seem hard to understand and scare off students with little understanding of it.

The focus of the project is to teach students what an algorithm is and how it works while using interactive technology to pique their interest. The students will be asked to write a program that navigates a Cozmo inside a maze, retrieves a block, and returns it to the user.

The Technology Ambassador Program at [GGC](http://www.ggc.edu/tap) strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Outreach Activities
1. Super Saturday Series(S3), Nov.9, 2019, GGC. - middle and high school girls to promote IT and STEM career
2. Tap Expo, Oct.10, 2019,GGC. - To promote the IT field and the TAP program to college students
3. Classroom Workshops - on Nov.11, Nov.13 and Nov.15, 2019 3 occasions, to promote IT field to non-IT college students

## Publication & Workshops

## Technology
  <Logo src= {CosmoBot.src} alt="Cozmo Robot" link="https://ankicozmorobot.com/" />

## Setup & Installation
1. Download the Cozmo App (it can be found on the Google Play store and the Apple store).
2. Connect to Cozmo through its wifi (move its lift up and down and the wifi password will appear).
3. You should be connected to Cozmo now!
4. [How to construct a maze](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/wanda/blob/master/Documents/Using%20Interactive%20Technology%20To%20Teach%20%20Basic%20Algorithmic%20Instructions%20Maze%20Construction.pdf)

## Workshops
1. [Workshop step-by-step](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/wanda/blob/master/Documents/Using%20Interactive%20Technology%20to%20Teach%20Basic%20Algorithmic%20Instructions%20Step-by-Step.pdf)
2. [Commented code](https://github.com/TAP-GGC/wanda/blob/master/Code/Using%20Interactive%20Technology%20to%20Teach%20Basic%20Algorithmic%20Instructions%20Commented%20Code.pdf)

## How to run & Usage
1. Cozmo comes with a bunch of different activites that it is able to perform such as an Explorer Mode where the user can navigate it with the smart device connected, a visual progrramming mode where users are able to code Cozmo to do certain actions with block coding and much more.
